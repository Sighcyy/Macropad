# Macropad
*Build Guide and Final Image will be added once completed

I developed a compact Macropad designed for gaming, featuring 8 mechanical push-button switches, a rotary encoder, and an RGB LED for visual feedback. It uses an EC11 rotary encoder, 1 addressable RGB LED, and the Seeed XIAO RP2040 microcontroller, chosen for its small size and KMK firmware compatibility. The components are integrated with a custom PCB to ensure clean layout and reliable performance. The enclosure is fully 3D-printable, making the design easy to reproduce and customize. This Macropad provides a programmable, streamlined interface to enhance gaming control and responsiveness.
